Design Choices

The design of IkayStorez focused on simplicity, clarity, and responsiveness. A dark-themed header and hero section were chosen to create a modern, elegant look that highlights the brand name and “Shop Now” call-to-action. Bootstrap 5 was used for a consistent layout and effortless responsiveness across devices.

The product cards feature bold, centered images and clearly visible prices to attract attention and improve readability. Generous spacing, rounded corners, and subtle shadows were applied to make the interface clean and visually appealing. The footer maintains a minimal style to keep focus on the products while ensuring a professional finish.

Overall, the design balances aesthetics with usability — delivering a seamless shopping experience on both desktop and mobile screens.
